## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

Masjid visitors enter the mosque and see a digital display showing relevant Islamic content (videos/images) with current prayer times overlaid. The content rotates automatically, prioritizing items with higher sponsorship funding. Different displays within the same masjid can show different content configurations based on their location and purpose.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a masjid has configured content items with sponsorship amounts, **When** the display loads, **Then** it shows the top 10 highest-sponsored content items in a rotating carousel
2. **Given** prayer times are scheduled for the day, **When** the display is active, **Then** current prayer times are shown in a floating overlay at the configured position
3. **Given** multiple displays exist in one masjid, **When** each display is configured with different settings, **Then** each shows its specific content configuration independently
4. **Given** content includes YouTube videos and images, **When** the carousel rotates, **Then** videos play automatically and images display for a configured duration
5. **Given** the system language is set to Bahasa Malaysia, **When** any text is displayed, **Then** all interface elements appear in Bahasa Malaysia

### Edge Cases

- What happens when no sponsored content is available for display? will display a temp masjid logo and no content sign.
- How does the system handle network connectivity issues for YouTube videos? skip
- What occurs when prayer time data is unavailable or outdated? retry 3 times and show error.
- How does the display behave when content items are removed or updated? skip if removed
