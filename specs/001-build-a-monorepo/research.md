# Research: Masjid Suite Monorepo Technical Decisions

**Date**: 17 September 2025  
**Context**: Building a monorepo for Islamic community management applications starting with Profile Management System

## Technology Stack Research

### Monorepo Management: Turborepo
**Decision**: Use Turborepo for monorepo orchestration  
**Rationale**: 
- Intelligent build caching and parallelization for faster CI/CD
- Excellent TypeScript support and incremental builds
- Built-in remote caching capabilities for team collaboration
- Superior task pipeline management compared to alternatives
- Active development by Vercel with strong community support

**Alternatives considered**:
- Nx: More complex setup, heavier tooling overhead
- Lerna: Legacy tool, maintenance mode, slower builds
- Rush: Microsoft-centric, steeper learning curve
- Custom scripts: No caching, poor scalability

### Package Management: pnpm
**Decision**: Use pnpm for package management and workspace coordination  
**Rationale**:
- Significant disk space savings through symlinked dependencies
- Faster installation times compared to npm/yarn
- Built-in workspace support that integrates well with Turborepo
- Strict dependency resolution prevents phantom dependencies
- Better security through content-addressable storage

**Alternatives considered**:
- npm workspaces: Slower, less efficient disk usage
- Yarn Classic: Legacy, maintenance mode
- Yarn Berry: Complex PnP system, compatibility issues

### Frontend Framework: React 18 + Vite
**Decision**: React 18 with Vite build tool  
**Rationale**:
- React 18 provides concurrent features and improved performance
- Vite offers lightning-fast development server with HMR
- Native ES modules support and optimized bundling
- Excellent TypeScript integration out of the box
- Rich ecosystem compatibility with MUI and other libraries

**Alternatives considered**:
- Next.js: Overkill for multi-app monorepo, better suited for single apps
- Create React App: Deprecated, slower development experience
- Vue/Angular: Team expertise and ecosystem considerations favor React

### UI Component Library: Material-UI (MUI) v5
**Decision**: Material-UI v5 for component library  
**Rationale**:
- Comprehensive component set following Material Design principles
- Excellent TypeScript support and accessibility features
- Strong theming system for consistent design across apps
- Active maintenance and regular updates
- Large community and extensive documentation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Ant Design: Less flexible theming, Chinese-centric design language
- Chakra UI: Smaller component library, less mature ecosystem
- Custom components: High development overhead, maintenance burden

### Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
**Decision**: Supabase for backend-as-a-service with PostgreSQL  
**Rationale**:
- Real-time subscriptions for collaborative features
- Built-in authentication with role-based access control
- Auto-generated REST and GraphQL APIs
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
- Local development environment with Docker
- Open source alternative to Firebase with SQL database

**Alternatives considered**:
- Firebase: NoSQL limitations, vendor lock-in concerns
- Raw PostgreSQL + Express: Higher development overhead
- Prisma + PostgreSQL: Additional complexity layer

## Architecture Patterns Research

### Authentication Strategy
**Decision**: Supabase Auth with email/password and Google OAuth  
**Rationale**:
- Built-in user management and session handling
- Support for multiple authentication providers
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- Role-based access control through database policies
- Integration with Row Level Security

### State Management
**Decision**: React Query + Zustand for state management  
**Rationale**:
- React Query for server state management and caching
- Zustand for client-side global state (lightweight)
- Reduces boilerplate compared to Redux
- Excellent TypeScript support and DevTools integration

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux Toolkit: Heavier setup, more boilerplate
- SWR: Less feature-rich than React Query
- Context API only: Performance issues with frequent updates

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright  
**Rationale**:
- Vitest: Fast unit testing with native ESM and TypeScript support
- React Testing Library: Component testing focused on user interactions
- Playwright: Cross-browser E2E testing with excellent debugging tools
- All tools integrate well with Vite and TypeScript

**Alternatives considered**:
- Jest: Slower startup, requires additional configuration for ESM
- Cypress: Heavier resource usage, less reliable than Playwright

## Malaysian Format Requirements Research

### Address Format
**Decision**: Implement Malaysian postal address format validation  
**Rationale**:
- Support for standard Malaysian address structure
- Postcode validation for valid Malaysian postal codes (5 digits)
- State/territory dropdown with proper Malaysian states
- Integration with Malaysian postal code database if available

### Phone Number Format
**Decision**: Malaysian phone number format validation  
**Rationale**:
- Support for mobile numbers (01x-xxxxxxx format)
- Landline numbers with area codes
- International format (+60) support
- Validation using libphonenumber-js library

### Name Format
**Decision**: Support for Malay, Chinese, and Indian name patterns  
**Rationale**:
- Flexible name fields supporting multiple cultural naming conventions
- Unicode support for various scripts
- Optional fields for traditional/cultural names

## Scalability Research

### Database Design
**Decision**: Implement database partitioning and indexing strategy  
**Rationale**:
- Horizontal scaling through proper table partitioning
- Optimized indexes for common query patterns
- Database connection pooling for performance
- Read replicas for scaling read operations

### Application Architecture
**Decision**: Micro-frontend architecture within monorepo  
**Rationale**:
- Independent deployment of applications
- Shared packages for common functionality
- Module federation for runtime code sharing if needed
- Clear boundaries between applications

## Development Experience Research

### Code Quality Tools
**Decision**: ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript strict mode  
**Rationale**:
- Consistent code formatting across all packages
- Type safety with strict TypeScript configuration
- Automated code quality checks in CI/CD
- Pre-commit hooks for immediate feedback

### Development Environment
**Decision**: VS Code with recommended extensions  
**Rationale**:
- Excellent TypeScript and React development experience
- Integrated debugging for all technologies in stack
- Extension marketplace for additional tooling
- Team consistency through shared workspace settings

## Integration Patterns Research

### API Design
**Decision**: GraphQL with Supabase auto-generated schema  
**Rationale**:
- Type-safe API queries with automatic TypeScript generation
- Efficient data fetching with single requests
- Real-time subscriptions for collaborative features
- Automatic CRUD operations through Supabase

**Alternatives considered**:
- REST API: More verbose, multiple requests for related data
- tRPC: Requires custom backend, less alignment with Supabase

### Error Handling
**Decision**: Centralized error handling with toast notifications  
**Rationale**:
- Consistent error messaging across applications
- User-friendly error display with MUI Snackbar
- Structured error logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation for offline scenarios

## Summary of Key Decisions

1. **Build System**: Turborepo + pnpm for optimal monorepo management
2. **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite + MUI for modern, fast development
3. **Backend**: Supabase for rapid backend development with PostgreSQL
4. **Testing**: Vitest + RTL + Playwright for comprehensive testing
5. **Architecture**: Micro-frontend approach with shared packages
6. **Localization**: Malaysian format support for addresses and phone numbers
7. **Scalability**: Database optimization and horizontal scaling patterns

All technical decisions align with the requirement for extensibility and future application additions by contributors.
