# Feature Specification: Masjid Suite Monorepo with Profile Management System

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-monorepo`  
**Created**: 16 September 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build a monorepo that consist of various applications for masjids suite, first application is the profile app, where is used to setup the system init for the whole system. There will be a super admin, masjid admin, registered user and public users. only the superadmin details is set on the .env file. masjid admin, registered user and public users details are in the database. super admins can create masjids, approve masjid admins from a selection of registered users. all users needs to update complete their profile here, such as full name, address, phone number, email , etc. there can be more than one masjid admins. this system will be running on top of a local supabase server. contributors for this monorepo will add more apps in the future therefore also provide intruction how to use specify to add new app and features."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
The Masjid Suite is a comprehensive system that enables Islamic communities to manage their mosque operations digitally. The first application, the Profile App, serves as the foundation by establishing user roles, authentication, and profile management across the entire suite. Super admins initialize the system, create masjid entities, and approve local administrators. Masjid admins manage their specific mosque community, while registered users and public users interact with various services based on their access levels.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Super Admin Workflows
1. **Given** the system is freshly installed, **When** super admin logs in with credentials from .env file, **Then** they can access the system initialization dashboard
2. **Given** super admin is logged in, **When** they create a new masjid entry, **Then** the masjid is added to the system with pending admin assignment status
3. **Given** registered users have applied for masjid admin roles, **When** super admin reviews applications, **Then** they can approve or reject candidates and assign them to specific masjids

#### Masjid Admin Workflows
1. **Given** a user is approved as masjid admin, **When** they log in for the first time, **Then** they must complete their full profile before accessing admin features
2. **Given** masjid admin has completed profile, **When** they access their dashboard, **Then** they can view and manage their assigned masjid's community members
3. **Given** multiple admins are assigned to one masjid, **When** any admin makes changes, **Then** all admins for that masjid can see the updates

#### Registered User Workflows
1. **Given** a new user wants to join the system, **When** they register, **Then** they must provide basic information and complete their profile
2. **Given** a registered user wants to become masjid admin, **When** they apply for the role, **Then** their application is queued for super admin review
3. **Given** a registered user has incomplete profile, **When** they try to access certain features, **Then** they are redirected to complete missing profile information

#### Public User Workflows
1. **Given** a public user visits the system, **When** they browse available information, **Then** they can view public masjid information without registration
2. **Given** a public user wants to access member features, **When** they attempt restricted actions, **Then** they are prompted to register

### Edge Cases
- What happens when super admin credentials are lost or corrupted in .env file? - redeploy with new .env
- How does system handle duplicate masjid admin applications for the same masjid? masjid and admin has many to many relation
- What occurs when a masjid admin is assigned to multiple masjids? he will need to select which masjid to view
- How does system manage profile completion validation across different user types? once the user saves his name, contact number and address and select his home masjid, the masjid admin will be notified to view and approve.
- What happens when database connectivity to Supabase is lost? retry

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### User Management & Authentication
- **FR-001**: System MUST store super admin credentials in environment configuration file
- **FR-002**: System MUST store masjid admin, registered user, and public user data in database
- **FR-003**: System MUST support four distinct user roles: super admin, masjid admin, registered user, and public user
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow super admins to create new masjid entities

- **FR-008**: System MUST validate profile completeness before allowing access to role-specific features
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to update their profile information after initial completion
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist profile changes across user sessions

#### System Architecture
- **FR-011**: System MUST be structured as a monorepo containing multiple applications
- **FR-012**: System MUST designate the Profile App as the initial system initialization application
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide extension points for future application additions by contributors

- **FR-016**: System MUST restrict masjid admin approval functionality to super admins only
- **FR-017**: System MUST allow masjid admins to access only their assigned masjid's data
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide appropriate access levels for registered and public users

#### Development & Extension
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide documentation for adding new applications to the monorepo
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide documentation for using the specify system to add new features
- **FR-021**: System MUST maintain consistent authentication and profile management across all future applications

### Areas Needing Clarification
- **FR-022**: System MUST handle user authentication via by supabase email sign in by default, and google as secondary. 
- **FR-023**: System MUST retain user data forever.
- **FR-024**: System MUST support unlimmited number of users/masjids
- **FR-025**: System MUST handle profile validation with malaysian format
- **FR-026**: System MUST manage masjid admin role changes by super admin

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **User**: Represents all system users with core attributes (id, email, role, profile_completion_status). Base entity for role-specific extensions
- **SuperAdmin**: Extends User, stores credentials in .env file, has system-wide permissions for masjid and admin management  
- **MasjidAdmin**: Extends User, database-stored with masjid assignments, can have multiple assignments, requires profile completion
- **RegisteredUser**: Extends User, database-stored with application status for admin roles, can apply for masjid admin positions
- **PublicUser**: Extends User, minimal data storage, limited system access without registration requirements
- **Masjid**: Represents mosque entities with identifying information, administrative assignments, and community member associations
- **Profile**: Contains detailed user information (full_name, address, phone_number, email, additional_fields), linked to User entities
- **AdminApplication**: Tracks registered user applications for masjid admin roles, includes application status and super admin review data
- **Application**: Represents individual apps within the monorepo structure, contains metadata for app management and integration

## Additional Documentation Requirements

### Specify System Usage Guide
The specification includes requirements for comprehensive documentation to help contributors add new applications and features:

1. **Adding New Applications**: Documentation must explain monorepo structure, application integration patterns, shared authentication, and profile management integration
2. **Using Specify for Features**: Documentation must provide step-by-step guides for using the specify system to add features to existing applications or create new feature specifications
3. **Development Standards**: Documentation must establish coding standards, testing requirements, and integration guidelines for the monorepo

This foundational Profile App serves as the template and integration point for all future applications in the Masjid Suite ecosystem.
