   - Resubmit rejected content with modifications
   - Delete pending or rejected content
   - Track submission and approval dates

3. **Admin Content Approval** (`/admin/approvals`):

2. **T015: Real-time Notifications** - Live status updates using Supabase subscriptions
3. **Content Preview Modal** - Full-screen preview with more detailed information
4. **Bulk Content Operations** - Select and approve/reject multiple items at once
5. **Advanced Content Scheduling** - Time-specific display controls and recurring content
6. **Content Analytics** - View count and engagement metrics for approved content
7. **Content Templates** - Pre-defined layouts for common content types

## Repository State

The workspace now has a fully functional content management system that addresses the original issue: **"seeing no change on the hub app"**. Users can now:

- Navigate to content management features via the sidebar
- Create and submit content for approval
- Administrators can review and approve/reject content
