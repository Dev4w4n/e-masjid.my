# Feature Specification: Hub App Content Management and Approval System

**Feature Branch**: `003-we-need-to`  
**Created**: 24 September 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "we need to change things that can be done in the hub app. registered users are able to create content for the tv-display and send to any masjid. masjid admins for that specific masjid will recieve the request and would need to approve it. the content is specific to a masjid. masjid admins will have full athority for the tv-display settings for the masjid. all this need to be done on the hub app. the tv-display app only acts as a display and no configuration can be done on the tv-display."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Parsed: Content creation, approval workflow, admin controls
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: registered users, masjid admins
   ‚Üí Actions: create content, send requests, approve/reject, configure display
   ‚Üí Data: tv-display content, masjid-specific settings
   ‚Üí Constraints: approval required, masjid-specific permissions
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Clarified: Content types are images and YouTube videos
   ‚Üí Clarified: TV display settings include content rotation timing and display schedule
   ‚Üí Clarified: Rejected requests notify users who can modify and resubmit
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow identified: create ‚Üí submit ‚Üí approve/reject ‚Üí display
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Content creation, approval workflow, admin permissions
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Content, Approval Request, Masjid, User permissions
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All clarifications addressed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a registered user, I want to create content for masjid TV displays so that I can share relevant information with the community, while ensuring masjid admins maintain control over what appears on their displays.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a registered user is logged into the hub app, **When** they create content and submit it to a specific masjid, **Then** the content request is sent to that masjid's admins for approval
2. **Given** a masjid admin receives a content request, **When** they review and approve it, **Then** the content becomes available for display on their masjid's TV display
3. **Given** a masjid admin is managing their display settings, **When** they configure display parameters, **Then** these settings apply only to their specific masjid's TV display
4. **Given** content is approved for a masjid, **When** the TV display app loads, **Then** it shows only approved content specific to that masjid

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a content request is rejected by masjid admin? Registered users receive notification of rejection and can modify content for resubmission
- How does the system handle content requests to non-existent masjids? System prevents saving by requiring masjid selection from valid list
- What occurs when multiple admins exist for the same masjid? All admins for the masjid can view and manage requests collaboratively
- How are conflicting display settings resolved? No conflicts occur as each masjid maintains separate TV displays managed independently by their admins

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow registered users to create content for TV displays within the hub app
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to submit content requests to specific masjids
- **FR-003**: System MUST notify masjid admins when content requests are submitted for their masjid
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow masjid admins to approve or reject content requests for their specific masjid
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure content is masjid-specific and only displays on approved masjid's TV display
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide masjid admins full authority over TV display settings for their masjid
- **FR-007**: System MUST restrict TV display app to display-only functionality with no configuration capabilities
- **FR-008**: System MUST enforce masjid admin permissions so admins can only manage their assigned masjid
- **FR-009**: System MUST track approval status of content requests (pending, approved, rejected)
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow creation of image content and YouTube video content for TV displays
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow masjid admins to configure content rotation timing (in seconds) and display schedule settings
- **FR-012**: System MUST notify users when content requests are rejected, provide rejection reasons from admins, and allow content modification and resubmission

_Note: All user interface requirements MUST be accompanied by Playwright test scenarios for E2E validation. Test scenarios MUST specify mock data requirements for unit tests and ID retrieval strategy for E2E tests._

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Content**: Represents user-created material for TV displays, including type, data, target masjid, and approval status
- **Approval Request**: Links content to masjid with status tracking (pending/approved/rejected) and admin decision timestamp
- **Masjid**: Represents mosque entity with associated admins and display configuration settings
- **User Role**: Defines permissions (registered user, masjid admin) and masjid associations for admins
- **Display Configuration**: Masjid-specific settings that control TV display behavior and appearance
