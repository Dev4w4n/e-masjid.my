## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10

- Q: How should the public app determine which masjid's content to display? ‚Üí A: Display all contents without masjid filter
- Q: What is the exact URL or routing path for the "Tambah Iklan" button to redirect users to the hub app? ‚Üí A: Make it configurable in the .env where currently it is on localhost:3000
- Q: What is the expected concurrent user scale and data volume for performance planning? ‚Üí A: Medium scale - 100-1,000 concurrent users, 1,000-10,000 content items
- Q: Should the public app implement rate limiting or abuse prevention mechanisms for public access? ‚Üí A: No rate limiting needed, rely on infrastructure/CDN protection
- Q: Should the public app implement content caching, and if so, what is the acceptable content freshness delay? ‚Üí A: Long cache - 1-24 hours (optimized for performance)

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A member of the public visits the E-Masjid.My public site to discover halal businesses and community advertisements from all masjids nationwide. They can browse all approved content without needing to log in, filter by categories, and view detailed information about each advertisement. When they want to add their own advertisement, they click "Tambah Iklan" which directs them to the hub app for registration and login.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user visits the public site homepage, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see:
   - An Islamic-themed header with "masjidbro.my" branding
   - A "Tambah Iklan" (Add Advertisement) link in the header that routes to the hub app
   - All approved content from all masjids nationwide displayed in a grid/carousel
   - Category filter options to browse by business type
   - SEO-optimized meta tags, structured data, and semantic HTML

2. **Given** a user is viewing the content listing, **When** they select a category filter, **Then** only content matching that category is displayed

3. **Given** a user clicks on a content card, **When** the detail page loads, **Then** they see:
   - Full content details including title, description, images/videos
   - Sponsorship information if applicable
   - Contact information or business details
   - SEO-optimized content with proper schema markup

4. **Given** a user clicks "Tambah Iklan" in the header, **When** they are not logged in, **Then** they are redirected to the hub app's registration/login page

5. **Given** a search engine bot crawls the public site, **When** it indexes the pages, **Then** the bot can properly:
   - Read all meta tags (title, description, keywords)
   - Parse structured data (JSON-LD schema)
   - Index all content without JavaScript execution requirements
   - Follow semantic HTML structure

### Edge Cases

- What happens when no approved content exists across all masjids?
  - Display a friendly message: "Tiada iklan tersedia pada masa ini. Sila kembali semula nanti."
- What happens when a user tries to access content that has been removed or expired?
  - Show a 404 page with navigation back to home
- How does the system display masjid context for content?
  - Display masjid name/location on each content card
  - Show all approved content from all masjids in nationwide listing
- What happens with very slow network connections?
  - Show loading states with Islamic-themed spinners
  - Implement image lazy loading for performance
  - Leverage long-term caching (1-24 hours) to reduce repeated data fetches
- How are different content types (images vs YouTube videos) displayed?
  - Both types are displayed in the same grid format
  - YouTube videos show thumbnail with play icon overlay
