# Philosophy

The main goals for this system are listed below.

**Easy of use**

- Not everyone is an IT expert. Designing a system for non-IT people needs careful consideration.

**Time to use your IT skills for good deeds**

- Open source is a form of sadaqah which is a required practice in Islam.

**Longer living**

- Hosting/Tech companies may die, but we hope that by open-sourcing this project, it will live longer for the sake of ummah.

**We give, not take**

- We should be contributing to the Muslim community, rather than benefiting from them, especially the Masjid.
